### Hi ‚úåüèº

I'm aziz, I live in Akouda, Tunisia and I do IT stuff for work/fun.

Other than working on my own products/ideas, I do contracting/consulting work in software development, security and devops for multiple companies so I use other github accounts.

If you have a great startup idea and are looking for a technical co-founder let's jump on skype/zoom call and see how we can work together.
